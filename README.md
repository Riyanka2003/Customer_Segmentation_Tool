# Customer_Segmentation_Tool
Aim :-  Customer Segmentation Web App using Clustering Algorithms

Description :- Built a web app that segments customers based on behavioral data using clustering (K-Means). Users input recency, frequency, monetary value, and tenure, and the model assigns them to a customer segment. Aimed to help businesses personalize strategies through quick, data-driven insights.

Technologies:-
- Python – Core logic and data processing
- Streamlit – For building the user interface
- Scikit-learn – To implement clustering algorithms like K-Means
- Pandas & NumPy – For data manipulation and preprocessing
- JupyterLab Notebook - to run locally

Demo :- http://localhost:8501/
